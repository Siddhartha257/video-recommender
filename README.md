# Video Recommender System

This project is a Video Recommender System developed using Python. It leverages machine learning techniques to recommend videos based on user preferences. The primary focus is on dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering with K-Means.

## Features

- Dimensionality reduction with PCA for efficient processing
- Clustering using K-Means to group similar videos
- Visualization of clusters and principal components

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook

### Python Libraries

Install the required libraries using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Included Libraries:**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
